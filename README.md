# Capstone-Project-1 : New York City Airbnb
Airbnb has seen a meteoric growth since its inception in 2008 with the number of rentals listed on its website growing exponentially each year. Airbnb has successfully disrupted the traditional hospitality industry as more and more travellers, not just the ones who are looking for a bang for their buck but also business travellers resort to Airbnb as their premier accommodation provider. New York City has been one of the hottest markets for Airbnb, with over 52,000 listings as of November 2018. This means there are over 40 homes being rented out per square km. in NYC on Airbnb! One can perhaps attribute the success of Airbnb in NYC to the high rates charged by the hotels, which are primarily driven by the exorbitant rental prices in the city.
